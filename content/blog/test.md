Hello, and welcome to our blog!  My name is Adam and I am the owner and operator of The Hill Sound Studio.  I wear a lot of different hats at our company, and my blog posts will cover a variety of topics from music production, location audio, post audio for video, sound design, business development, client relations and much more.    

For our first Blog post I thought I would share a link to an article from October, 2016's issue of Professional Sound Magazine.

I had a lot of fun writing this article, big thanks to the magazine's editor, Andrew King for the request.
