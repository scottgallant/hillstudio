2017 was an incredible year for our humble, little studio.  With a growing focus on music production, Colin Buchanan and Adam Gallant both attended the Mix With The Masters seminar, hosted by the amazing Greg Wells.    
  
If you aren't familiar with the MWTM brand, have a quick google search and browse their website:  [https://mixwiththemasters.com/](https://mixwiththemasters.com/ "https://mixwiththemasters.com/")

Our studio also added some great hardware, including and SSL EQ strip, RME audio interface as well as software like the Oeksound Soothe Plugin:  [https://oeksound.com/soothe/](https://oeksound.com/soothe/ "https://oeksound.com/soothe/"), and Nugen MasterCheck Pro.    
  
Looking forward to some exciting contracts and releases in 2018 by Sorrey, Dylan Menzie, Little Cities and many more!

Best,  
Adam Gallant
