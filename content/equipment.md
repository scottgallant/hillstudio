Our studios consist of two rooms, Studio A and B.  Both based out or our residence in downtown Charlottetown, PEI.  

Studio A is a three hundred and thirty square foot outbuilding on our property.  The room is acoustically treated and is equipped with a powerful Pro Tools suite, high end analogue to digital conversion and industry standard creative and restorative software tools.

Our tracking setup is streamlined and designed with post flexibility in mind.  API preamps, Rupert Neve compression and SSL Equalization provide world class quality and a broad pallet.

Our Studio B room is equipped with an incredible Antelope Audio interface, acoustically treated with Prime Acoustic paneling and features a hundred year old Heinztman piano in perfection condition.
